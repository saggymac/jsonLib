jsonLib
=======

a streaming swift native json library

# Central idea
Build a JSON parser that efficiently just rips through characters as they come. Allow streaming (http packet chunking). And build it using native Swift objects (that is, don't depend on NSJSONSerializer).

# Status
1. Basic buildout is done.
2. Much more testing needed.
3. Performance analysis needed.
